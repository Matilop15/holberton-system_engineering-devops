The name of the new user should be replica_user, with the host name set to %, and can have whatever password youâ€™d like.
replica_user must have the appropriate permissions to replicate your primary MySQL server.
holberton_user will need SELECT privileges on the mysql.user table in order to check that replica_user was created with the correct permissions.

CODE:

CREATE USER 'replica_user'@'%';

GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON mysql.user TO 'replica_user'@'%';

GRANT SELECT ON mysql.user TO 'holberton_user'@'localhost';
