Create a database named tyrell_corp.
Within the tyrell_corp database create a table named nexus6 and add at least one entry to it.
Make sure that holberton_user has SELECT permissions on your table so that we can check that the table exists and is not empty.

CODE:

CREATE DATABASE tyrell_corp;

use tyrell_corp;

CREATE TABLE nexus6 (name VARCHAR(30), age INT);

INSERT INTO nexus6 VALUES ('Matias', 22);

GRANT SELECT ON tyrell_corp to 'holberton_user'@'localhost';
