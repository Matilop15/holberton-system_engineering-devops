# Holbertonschool-low_level_programming

## 0x11. What happens when you type google.com in your browser and press Enter

## Details
For this project, students are expected to look at this concept:
* [Technical Writing Tips and Tricks for students](https://intranet.hbtn.io/concepts/134) 

## Background Context
Being a Full-Stack Software Engineer means you’re comfortable interacting with any layer of the stack.
A way to easily assess this is to simply ask an engineer to explain how a software system works. They can have a general overview of the flow or can choose to dig deep in a certain area.
Let’s practice by exploring the infrastructure side (network, servers, security…) of the question.

## Tasks
### 0. What happens whe..
This question is a good test of whether you understand DNS. Many software engineering candidates struggle with this concept, so if you do well on this question, you are already way ahead of the curve. If you take this project seriously and write an excellent article, it may be something that will grab the attention of future employers.
Write a blog post explaining what happens when you type   ` https://www.google.com `   in your browser and press   ` Enter `  .
Requirements, your post must cover:
* DNS request
* TCP/IP
* Firewall
* HTTPS/SSL
* Load-balancer
* Web server
* Application server
* Database

### 1. Everything's better with a pretty diagram
The diagram should show:
* DNS resolution
* that the request hitting server IP on the appropriate port
* that the traffic is encrypted
* that the traffic goes through a firewall
* that the request is distributed via a load balancer
* that the web server answers the request by serving a web page
* that the application server generates the web page
* that the application server request data from the database
